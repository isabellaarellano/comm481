				<h1>Youth Ministry Leader, Woodbridge Community Church (2022 - Present)</h1>	
				
				<p>Woodbridge Community Church is  located in Irvine, California. The WCC Youth Ministry is our next generation group of about 20-25 students ranging from 7th grade to 12th grade. As a Youth Ministry Leader at WCC, I lead my small group of 7th-10th grade girls through Gospel-based messages, participate in musical worship, help with games, serve dinner, and more every Friday night! We also host special events annually for our students to enjoy! As a staff member, I participate in all aspects of planning: scheduling, games, coordinating, content creation, and more. Whether that's reaching out to students, finding Bible plans to suit student needs, celebrating the students, or just logistical planning, being a Youth Leader is a privilege and a passion that I'm blessed to be a part of!</p>

				<h3>Content Creation</h3>
					
				  <p>Our Youth Ministry has several high school student leaders! Part of my position includes overseeing a few of the student leaders who manage our Youth Group's Instagram, as well as making posts every now and then. In addition, I created logos for our camp shirts and profile!

					<h4>Retreats</h4>
						
						<p>Some of my favorite events that I have been a part of are the WCC Youth Ministry's camps! Every year, we host a 4-day summer camp and a 4-day winter retreat. As part of the staff, we spend months planning the schedule, games, activities, snacks, and worship. We work closely with the camp staff and coordinate all logistics to achieve a successful camp for the students to enjoy!</p>

						<h4>Lock-Ins</h4>
						
							<p>Lock-ins are annual events where we stay up all night with the students! We plan a fun program filled with games, a message, activities, and more! It is a fun bonding experience for the students to make long-lasting memories!</p>

					<div id="banquet">
						
						<h4>Banquet</h4>
						
							<p>Middle and High School can be an awkward time -- especially when talking to those of the opposite gender. Because our world is so technologically based, we wanted to create a space where students could have face-to-face interactions in a safe environment. During a relationships series, our team organized a banquet! We paired the students,  encouraging them to have fruitful conversations and learn important skills such as active listening and proper etiquette.</p>

				<h3>Friday Nights</h3>
				  
				  <p>My typical Friday night consists of Youth Group! We plan games, prepare worship, work with student leaders, serve dinner, and lead small groups. Our Friday nights require weekly coordination and communication to have a smooth program!</p>

			<h1>Crew Leader at Vacation Bible School, Woodbridge Community Church (2015 - Present)</h1>
					
					<p>I grew up attending Vacation Bible School every summer so it is a blessing to help bring the event to life for the next generation! VBS is a weeklong themed event where we teach Bible stories, dance, play games, and create fun connections! As a crew leader, I lead 5 elementary aged kids to various stations to learn Gospel-based messages! Additionally, I assist with our large group station where we recap the day, play music, and do fun science experiments!</p>
