					<h1>COMM 497T</h1>
					
					<p>My Comm 497T class and I were assigned the project of planning an event in the Arboretum and Botanical Gardens at Cal State Fullerton. Our goal was to spread awareness of the Arboretum and its resources to CSUF students. We planned the Garden Flea Market which was a student-based flea market with food trucks, student vendors, live music, and 150 free burgers!

					<h1>EVENT DIRECTOR</h1>
					
					<p>As the Event Director, I oversaw all the event planning, made executive decisions, led team discussions and brainstorming sessions, and managed the budget. I was also the main contact with our client (the Arboretum) and the spokesperson of our team. I led a group of 3 directors who managed their own committees and met with our professor weekly. Some tasks that I completed during my time as the Event Director include a master timeline which outlined each position's tasks every week and a status report of our progress.</p>

				<h1>EVENT DAY</h1>
					
					<p>At the event, I helped our on-site director manage the execution of the event. I was a contact for the food trucks and student vendors, and I gave a thank you speech during the event! It was so exciting to see our event come to life!</p>

				<h1>POST-EVENT</h1>
					<p>One of the most important stages of event-planning is analyzing the success of our event! Our event had an estimated attendance of 580 people, many of our vendors sold out, and the food trucks had successful sales! I led our debrief discussion with our client and team, discussing areas of improvement and growth. Additionally, I created a manual outlining our event-planning journey to help the future event director!</p>
